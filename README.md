# Apdex Board - vanilla JS
Apdex Board

## Table of contents
[TBD]

## Development - Run the example

### Step 1: Install dependencies
* `npm install`

### Step 2: Run the application
* `npm start` (It runs a live server on port :8080)

## Tests
* `npm run test`

## Decisions
### view.js
* According with the grid-mode.jpg each apps list by host has 5 elements (APPS_NUMBER constant).
* Release number is shown through a window.alert() instead of a popup following the indications: "When clicking over an app, an alert dialog including the release number has to be shown."

## Nice to have
* Cypress could be added in order to test end to end functionalies
